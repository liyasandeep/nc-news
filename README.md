# Northcoders News (A React Project)

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website.

Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics. Each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted using the API. Users can also add comments about an article. The logged in user has the ability to delete their own comments.

React was used to build the front end of the news website which makes use of an API, which was also built by me.
